    protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
    It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks
    beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed
    object management systems, through extension of its request methods,
    error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation
    of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of
    the data being transferred.}},

    document describes the DoD Standard Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
    There have been nine earlier editions of the ARPA TCP specification on
    which this standard is based, and the present text draws heavily from
    them. There have been many contributors to this work both in terms of
    concepts and in terms of text. This edition clarifies several details
    and removes the end-of-letter buffer-size adjustments, and redescribes
    the letter mechanism as a push function.}},
