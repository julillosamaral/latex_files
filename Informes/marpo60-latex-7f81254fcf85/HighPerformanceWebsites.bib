  abstract = {{This specification defines a lossless compressed data format. The
	data can be produced or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long sequentially
	presented input data stream, using only an a priori bounded amount
	of intermediate storage. The format presently uses the DEFLATE compression
	method but can be easily extended to use other compression methods.
	It can be implemented readily in a manner not covered by patents.
	This specification also defines the ADLER-32 checksum (an extension
	and improvement of the Fletcher checksum), used for detection of
	data corruption, and provides an algorithm for computing it.}},

	is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks
	beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed
	object management systems, through extension of its request methods,
	error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation
	of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently
	of the data being transferred.}},
